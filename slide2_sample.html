SLIDE 2: The Hardcode Trap]</h3><p><strong>Visual:</strong></p><p># Hardcoded name everywhere...<br /># ...and imagine 50 more lines like this.<br />print("Welcome, Shadow_Blade!")<br />print("Shadow_Blade leveled up!")<br />print("Shadow_Blade defeated the boss!")<br />print("Shadow_Blade's score: 1000")</p><p><strong>Audio:</strong><br />“Imagine you hardcode your character’s name everywhere in your game: welcome messages, level-up notifications, boss defeats—and imagine 50 more lines like this. This works… until you change your mind. And you will. Because naming a character is a sacred ritual: you pick something cool, then immediately regret it. Without variables, you have to hunt down every single mention and change it manually. Miss even one line and your game becomes inconsistent.”</p><p><strong>[22 seconds]</strong></p><h3><a id="slide-3-the-missed-one-bug"></a>[
