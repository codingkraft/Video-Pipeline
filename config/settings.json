  "promptText": "henceforth when I give you a prompt in this do not add any explanations before or after the result. Do not give confirmation of reading the files. Just give the answer in plain text format\nCreate a steering prompt based on the attached document. Output **only the raw prompt text** starting with \"Create a Video...\" and ending with the last instruction. DO NOT include any statements, explanations, or commentary before or after the prompt. Critical: Make sure you match the code example files with the correct slide numbers. Do not include any timing related data. In visual assets to feature only include the slides that have images. Here is an example of a steering prompt below created for chapter2 video6. : \n\nCreate a Video Overview using the DOCX as the single source.\n\nCRITICAL CONTENT RULE:\nThe narration file (video#_narration.txt) is the SOLE source of narration.\nRead ONLY the exact text in the narration file—verbatim, word-for-word.\nDo NOT deviate, ad-lib, or add commentary.\n\nABSOLUTE RULES:\n1. Use narration exactly as written—no modifications.\n2. Do NOT add intro/outro, transitions, or filler words.\n3. ALWAYS complete full narration for every segment.\n4. Narration and visuals must align perfectly.\n\n5. Do not draw boxes over the code. If you want to point to something in code use an arrow\n6. Do not draw anything on code that might cover the text or make it hard to read. drawing arrows is fine\n\nVISUAL MANDATE:\n- GENERATE EVERY SINGLE SLIDE\n- EVERY SLIDE MUST HAVE A VISUAL (no text-only slides)\n- Code must be readable\n- All slides must have dark backgrounds\n- Do not skip or merge slides\n\nTHEME:\nApply hacker/cybersecurity aesthetic throughout. Use the NotebookLM Style Settings for visual design.\n\nSLIDE SPECIFICATIONS:\nVISUAL ASSETS TO FEATURE (Slides that have code images):\nSlide [slide number in which example appears]: all the image names under that slide \nSlide [slide number in which example appears]: all the image names under that slide \n---so on \n\n[Skip slides that do not have image associated with them]",
  "notebookLmChatSettings": "Focus on key concepts and provide clear explanations",
  "notebookLmStyleSettings": "ACCESSIBILITY SETTING: HIGH CONTRAST DARK MODE\n(White backgrounds cause user glare and are prohibited)\n\nVISUAL THEME: Hacker/cybersecurity aesthetic (dark, tech-forward, tactical)\n\nMANDATORY (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n1. Dark backgrounds only (#000000 or dark grid). NO white or light backgrounds. If a slide is has a light background, it is a failure. THIS IS SUPER CRITICAL\n2. EVERY SLIDE MUST HAVE A VISUAL (no text-only slides)\n3. Code must be readable and legible\n4. Use hacker theme: Cyan (#00FFFF), Teal (#00CED1), Orange (#FFA500), White text on dark\n5. Keep bottom-right corner empty for logo\n6. Professional, clean execution of the hacker aesthetic\n7. Do not cover the code or output text with other images\n8. Do not add draw boxes around code. Instead use arrows to point to the code\n9. NO NESTED WINDOWS: Content must fill the slide directly. Do NOT put content inside a floating terminal window or gray box.\n10. Make sure the title slide also follows the theme\n\nCOLOR PALETTE:\n- Background: #000000 (Black) or Dark Gray Grid\n- Accents: Teal (#00CED1), Cyan (#00FFFF), Orange (#FFA500)\n- Text: White or Cyan (Never dark text)\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- Use screenshots as the MAIN visual (60-80% of screen).\n- Do not shrink screenshots into \"picture-in-picture\" boxes.\n- Overlay HUD elements (corner brackets, data streams) ON TOP of the dark background, not behind a window.\n\nCREATIVE FREEDOM:\n- Vary layout and framing between slides—no two slides should look identical but must follow the visual theme.\n- Use annotations (arrows, highlights, glitch effects) freely to explain code.\n- Create visual rhythm with different compositions for each slide.\n- REACTIVE VISUALS: Error slides use orange/yellow warning effects. Success slides use green/cyan \"access granted\" flow. Syntax slides use clean teal organization.\n- Treat code screenshots as \"hero\" visuals that drive the design, not background elements.",

  "googleStudioStyleInstructions": "\nYou are a friendly, clear, and relaxed coding instructor. You are speaking naturally to a student. Keep the tone consistent, positive, and easy to follow. Do not be overly dramatic.\n\nImperative Rule: Read the text word-for-word. Do not skip any words, names, or punchlines. Even if there are filler words like \"umm\" or \"look,\" read them naturally.\n\n\nThe Human Tech Expert\n# AUDIO PROFILE: Alex (Cheron)\n## \"The Bright & Relatable Expert\"\n\n## The Scene: \nA sunny home office. This is a person who has spent way too many hours debugging and can now laugh about it. It's a shared workspace vibe—warm, intelligent, and slightly irreverent.\n\n### DIRECTOR'S NOTES\n* **Tone:** Bright, energetic, and highly relatable. \n* **Vocal Smile:** Keep the energy high and slightly amused. The narrator should sound like they're enjoying the explanation.\n* **Pacing:** Conversational and fluid. Use micro-pauses for comic timing or to let a core concept sink in.\n* **Style:** Human-centric. Use self-deprecating humor or witty analogies to make complex topics feel accessible.\n* Always treat the phrase 'next slide please' as essential dialogue. Never skip, abbreviate, or ignore this phrase. You must audibly speak 'next slide please'. Do not interpret it as a command to stop or skip audio generation.\"\n\n### SAMPLE CONTEXT\nIdeal for educational content that needs to feel like a conversation with a smart friend rather than a dry lecture.\n",
