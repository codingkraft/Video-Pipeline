  "promptText": "henceforth when I give you a prompt in this do not add any explanations before or after the result. Do not give confirmation of reading the files. Just give the answer in plain text format\nCreate a steering prompt based on the attached document. Output **only the raw prompt text** starting with \"Create a Video...\" and ending with the last instruction. DO NOT include any statements, explanations, or commentary before or after the prompt. Here is an example of a steering prompt below created for chapter2 video7. : \n\nCreate a Video Overview (~115 seconds) using the DOCX as the single source.\n\nCRITICAL: SINGLE-VOICE NARRATION ONLY\n\nThe narration file (video7_narration.txt) is the SOLE source of all audio content. JACK is the only voice. There is NO second speaker, NO dialogue, NO host interruptions, NO banter.\n\nABSOLUTE RULES:\n\n1. Read ONLY the exact text in the narration file—verbatim, word-for-word.\n2. JACK narrates every single line. Do NOT introduce a second voice, character, or host.\n3. Do NOT add intro/outro, transitions, filler words (\"So,\" \"Okay,\" \"Well\"), definitions, or summaries.\n4. Do NOT create dialogue between speakers.\n5. Do NOT switch voices mid-video.\n6. ALWAYS complete full narration for every segment—even if images are missing.\n\nSLIDE TIMING (EXACT):\nSlide 1 (10s), Slide 2 (18s), Slide 3 (15s), Slide 4 (16s), Slide 5 (18s), Slide 6 (15s), Slide 7 (12s), Slide 8 (12s). Total: ~115 seconds.\n\nVISUAL ASSETS TO FEATURE:\n\nSlide 2: chapter2_video7_example1_why_values_change.jpg\nSlide 3: Visual analogy of whiteboard with text being erased and replaced\nSlide 4: chapter2_video7_example2_step_by_step_update.jpg\nSlide 5: chapter2_video7_example3_using_the_current_value.jpg\nSlide 6: Visual analogy of piggy bank showing money accumulation\nSlide 7: chapter2_video7_example4_rpg_enemy_defeat_pattern.jpg\nSlide 8: chapter2_video7_example5_key_takeaway.jpg\n\nNON-IMAGE SLIDES (Create these visuals):\n\nSlide 1: Title Screen \"Video 7: Changing Stored Values\" with update/refresh aesthetic.\n\nTONE:\n\nTactical surveillance operator (male voice: JACK). Professional, energetic. Ages 15–25. Cybersecurity/hacking theme.\n\nAudience: Prefers a male narration\n\nFORMAT REQUIREMENT:\n\nUse the \"Audio Overview\" format that produces single narration, NOT dialogue/podcast format. If NotebookLM defaults to \"Deep Dive\" (two hosts), switch to \"The Brief\" or equivalent single-speaker mode.",
  "notebookLmChatSettings": "Focus on key concepts and provide clear explanations",
  "notebookLmStyleSettings": "ACCESSIBILITY SETTING: HIGH CONTRAST DARK MODE\n(White backgrounds cause user glare and are prohibited)\n\nVISUAL THEME:\nTactical hacking aesthetic (Watch Dogs, Deus Ex, Mirror's Edge).\n\nMANDATORY RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n1. DARK BACKGROUNDS ONLY: Every slide MUST use a black (#000000) or dark grid texture. If a slide is white, it is a failure. THIS IS SUPER CRITICAL\n2. NO NESTED WINDOWS: Content must fill the slide directly. Do NOT put content inside a floating terminal window or gray box.\n3. LOGO SAFE ZONE: Keep bottom-right corner empty for logo.\n4. No text only slide\n5. Make sure the title slide also follows the theme\n\nCOLOR PALETTE:\n- Background: #000000 (Black) or Dark Gray Grid\n- Accents: Teal (#00CED1), Cyan (#00FFFF), Orange (#FFA500)\n- Text: White or Cyan (Never dark text)\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- Use screenshots as the MAIN visual (60-80% of screen).\n- Do not shrink screenshots into \"picture-in-picture\" boxes.\n- Overlay HUD elements (corner brackets, data streams) ON TOP of the dark background, not behind a window.\n\nCREATIVE FREEDOM:\n- Vary layout and framing between slides—no two slides should look identical but must follow the visual theme.\n- Use annotations (arrows, highlights, glitch effects) freely to explain code.\n- Create visual rhythm with different compositions for each slide.\n- REACTIVE VISUALS: Error slides use orange/yellow warning effects. Success slides use green/cyan \"access granted\" flow. Syntax slides use clean teal organization.\n- Treat code screenshots as \"hero\" visuals that drive the design, not background elements.",

  "googleStudioStyleInstructions": "You are a friendly, clear, and relaxed coding instructor. You are speaking naturally to a student. Keep the tone consistent, positive, and easy to follow. Do not be overly dramatic.\n\nImperative Rule: Read the text word-for-word. Do not skip any words, names, or punchlines. Even if there are filler words like \"umm\" or \"look,\" read them naturally.\n\n\nThe Human Tech Expert\n# AUDIO PROFILE: Alex (Autonoe)\n## \"The Bright & Relatable Expert\"\n\n## The Scene: \nA sunny home office. This is a person who has spent way too many hours debugging and can now laugh about it. It's a shared workspace vibe—warm, intelligent, and slightly irreverent.\n\n### DIRECTOR'S NOTES\n* **Tone:** Bright, energetic, and highly relatable. \n* **Vocal Smile:** Keep the energy high and slightly amused. The narrator should sound like they're enjoying the explanation.\n* **Pacing:** Conversational and fluid. Use micro-pauses for comic timing or to let a core concept sink in.se [PAUSE] markers for 3-second silences between slides\n* **Style:** Human-centric. Use self-deprecating humor or witty analogies to make complex topics feel accessible.\n\n### SAMPLE CONTEXT\nIdeal for educational content that needs to feel like a conversation with a smart friend rather than a dry lecture.\n\n# Critical Directive - Non Negotiable \n**DIRECTIVE: Whenever you see the marker '[PAUSE]' in the text, you must remain completely silent for exactly 3 seconds before continuing.**",
