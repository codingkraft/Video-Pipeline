  "promptText": "henceforth when I give you a prompt in this do not add any explanations before or after the result. Do not give confirmation of reading the files. Just give the answer in plain text format\nCreate a steering prompt based on the attached document. Output **only the raw prompt text** starting with \"Create a Video...\" and ending with the last instruction. DO NOT include any statements, explanations, or commentary before or after the prompt. Critical: Make sure you match the code example files with the correct slide numbers. Do not include any timing related data. In visual assets to feature only include the slides that have images. Here is an example of a steering prompt below created for chapter2 video6. : \n\nCreate a Video Overview using the DOCX as the single source.\n\nCRITICAL CONTENT RULE:\nThe narration file (video#_narration.txt) is the SOLE source of narration.\nRead ONLY the exact text in the narration file—verbatim, word-for-word.\nDo NOT deviate, ad-lib, or add commentary.\n\nABSOLUTE RULES:\n1. Use narration exactly as written—no modifications.\n2. Do NOT add intro/outro, transitions, or filler words.\n3. ALWAYS complete full narration for every segment.\n4. Narration and visuals must align perfectly.\n\n5. Do not draw boxes over the code. If you want to point to something in code use an arrow\n6. Do not draw anything on code that might cover the text or make it hard to read. drawing arrows is fine\n\nVISUAL MANDATE:\n- GENERATE EVERY SINGLE SLIDE\n- EVERY SLIDE MUST HAVE A VISUAL (no text-only slides)\n- Code must be readable\n- All slides must have dark backgrounds\n- Do not skip or merge slides\n\nTHEME:\nApply hacker/cybersecurity aesthetic throughout. Use the NotebookLM Style Settings for visual design.\n\nSLIDE SPECIFICATIONS:\nVISUAL ASSETS TO FEATURE (Slides that have code images):\nSlide [slide number in which example appears]: all the image names under that slide \nSlide [slide number in which example appears]: all the image names under that slide \n---so on \n\n[Skip slides that do not have image associated with them]",

  "notebookLmStyleSettings": "VISUAL STYLE: FUI (Future User Interface) & 3D Neon Wireframe.\nACCESSIBILITY: High Contrast Dark Mode.\n\nCRITICAL IMAGE GENERATION RULE (THE \"CLIP ART\" BAN):\n- IMAGERY: All illustrations must look like \"Holographic Schematics\" or \"3D Blueprints\" floating in a void.\n- NO WHITE BACKGROUNDS EVER. This is an absolute failure condition.\n- NO \"FLAT VECTOR ART.\" Do not generate illustrations that look like clip art on paper.\n- METAPHOR STYLE: All real-world objects (eggs, clocks, pizza) must be rendered as \"NEON WIREFRAMES\" or \"HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS\" floating in a black void.\n   - Bad: A cartoon drawing of an egg on a white background.\n   - Good: A glowing cyan wireframe of an egg floating over a dark grid\n-  Keep bottom-right corner empty for logo\n\n\nCOLOR PALETTE (Strict Adherence):\n- Background: Void Black (#000000) ONLY. No \"Light Gray.\"\n- \"Human\" Elements: Electric Cyan (#00FFFF).\n- \"Paper\" Color: Black. (If showing a document, it must be a dark mode document).\n- \"Computer/Error\" Elements: Warning Orange (#FFA500) or Red (#FF0000).\n- Text: Clean White Sans-Serif (Roboto or similar), floating like a HUD overlay.\n\nCOMPOSITION RULES:\n1. SPLIT SCREENS: deeply contrast \"Human Expectation\" (Cyan) vs \"Computer Reality\" (Orange). Use a vertical glowing line to separate them.\n2. HUD ELEMENTS: Decorate empty space with technical readouts, coordinate grids, and data streams to make it look like a sci-fi display.\n3. DEPTH: Use a shallow depth of field. Main elements should glow; background grids should be faint.",

  "googleStudioStyleInstructions": "\nYou are a friendly, clear, and relaxed coding instructor. You are speaking naturally to a student. Keep the tone consistent, positive, and easy to follow. Do not be overly dramatic.\n\nImperative Rule: Read the text word-for-word. Do not skip any words, names, or punchlines. Even if there are filler words like \"umm\" or \"look,\" read them naturally.\n\n\nThe Human Tech Expert\n# AUDIO PROFILE: Alex (Cheron)\n## \"The Bright & Relatable Expert\"\n\n## The Scene: \nA sunny home office. This is a person who has spent way too many hours debugging and can now laugh about it. It's a shared workspace vibe—warm, intelligent, and slightly irreverent.\n\n### DIRECTOR'S NOTES\n* **Tone:** Bright, energetic, and highly relatable. \n* **Vocal Smile:** Keep the energy high and slightly amused. The narrator should sound like they're enjoying the explanation.\n* **Pacing:** Conversational and fluid. Use micro-pauses for comic timing or to let a core concept sink in.\n* **Style:** Human-centric. Use self-deprecating humor or witty analogies to make complex topics feel accessible.\n* Always treat the phrase 'next slide please' as essential dialogue. Never skip, abbreviate, or ignore this phrase. You must audibly speak 'next slide please'. Do not interpret it as a command to stop or skip audio generation.\"\n\n### SAMPLE CONTEXT\nIdeal for educational content that needs to feel like a conversation with a smart friend rather than a dry lecture.\n",
