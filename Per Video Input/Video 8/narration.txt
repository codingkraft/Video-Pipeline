Video 8: Naming Rules
==================================================

Concept: Variable names follow rules (and good style saves you later)

[Slide 1: Title Screen]
You want variables for score, username, level, and everything else. But Python is picky about names. Use the wrong format and your code crashes instantly. Let's learn the rules so Python doesn't have a meltdown.

[Slide 2: The Club Bouncer]
Python is like a strict nightclub bouncer. It has a guest list. Your variable name shows up wearing sandals and a hyphen? Not getting in.

[Slide 3: Rule 1 — Allowed Characters (and why)]
Rule one: only letters, numbers, and underscores. A hyphen looks like subtraction, so Python thinks you're doing math. A space looks like two separate names. Underscores are the safe connector.

[Slide 4: Rule 2 — Don't Start With a Number]
Rule two: don't start with a number. Python sees a leading number and assumes you're doing math, not naming something.

[Slide 5: Rule 3 — Case Sensitivity + Python Convention]
Rule three: Python is case-sensitive—these are three different variables. It's like three people with the same name who get mad if you call them the wrong version. Python convention is to use lowercase_with_underscores, so names like player_score are the usual style.

[Slide 6: Rule 4 — Reserved Words]
Rule four: some words are already taken—print, if, for, while. Python called dibs. Choose a different name.

[Slide 7: Good Names vs Painful Names]
Beyond the rules: use descriptive names. player_score is clear. x is a mystery. Future you will open this code and whisper: 'Who wrote this?' Spoiler: it was you.

[Slide 8: File Naming Parallel]
It's like naming files. Chaos names waste time. Clear names save time. Variables are the same.

[Slide 9: Key Takeaway]
Letters, numbers, underscores. Start with a letter or underscore. Case-sensitive. Avoid reserved words. And choose names that make your code readable.

[Slide 1: Title Screen]
In Python, text data is called a String. But why? Let's break down what strings are, why they have that name, and why you'll use them constantly.

[Slide 2: What's a String?]
Strings are text wrapped in quotes. Usernames, messages, item names—anything made of characters is a string. Python doesn't judge what you type. It just stores it.

[Slide 3: Why "String"? (Beads Metaphor)]
It's called a string because it's a string of characters—like beads on a necklace. HELLO is five characters in order. Somebody named it that, and we've been living with it ever since.

[Slide 4: Quotes Freeze Text (Screenshot analogy)]
Quotes tell Python: 'This is literal text.' Even if it looks like math, Python won't calculate it. It stores the characters exactly as written—like a screenshot of a calculator, not a real calculation. You can't tap a screenshot and expect it to do math. That would be like expecting a photograph of a sandwich to be edible.

[Slide 5: Quotes Are Required]
Without quotes, Python assumes you're referring to a variable named Alex. If Alex doesn't exist, Python complains. Quotes make it literal text.

[Slide 6: Key Takeaway]
Strings are text in quotes. Quotes freeze text so Python stores it exactly.

[Slide 1: Title Screen]
Now let's talk about actual numbers. Python has integers for whole numbers and floats for decimals. Mixing numbers with strings is where the comedy—and the errors—begin.

[Slide 2: Integers (Whole Numbers)]
Integers are whole numbers. Great for counting: lives, scores, levels, number of players. You can't have 2.5 lives. That's not how games—or life—works.

[Slide 3: Floats (Decimals)]
Floats are decimals. Great for prices, percentages, and anything that needs precision. That dot is the clue: decimal point equals float.

[Slide 4: Numbers Don't Use Quotes]
Critical difference: numbers have no quotes. Put quotes around a number and you've turned it into text. Without quotes, 25 plus 5 gives you 30. With quotes, '25' is frozen text—you can't do math with it. Quotes change everything.

[Slide 5: Mixing Types (Blender)]
Think of math like a blender. Numbers are fruit—blend smoothly. Strings are rocks—blend that and something breaks. Python doesn't know what 'divide text' means, so it throws a TypeError and stops instead of guessing.

[Slide 6: When to Use Which]
Simple rule: text in quotes equals string. Whole numbers equal int. Decimals equal float. Match the type to the job and your code behaves.

[Slide 7: Key Takeaway]
Two number types: integers and floats. Don't put quotes around numbers unless you want text.
