# Code Block 1 (Slide 2: Character Profile (Multiple Types))
```python
hero_name = "Swift_Shadow_Assassin"
hero_level = 1
hero_speed = 0.1
hero_weapon = "Rusty Spoon"
runs_from_combat = True
```

# Code Block 2 (Slide 4: Printing Multiple Values (Comma Method))
```python
print("Hero:", hero_name)
print("Level:", hero_level)
print("Weapon:", hero_weapon)
print("Runs from combat:", runs_from_combat)
```

# Expected Output:
Hero: Swift_Shadow_Assassin
Level: 1
Weapon: Rusty Spoon
Runs from combat: True

# Code Block 3 (Slide 5: Combining Strings (Superglue))
```python
title = "The Legendary"
full_name = hero_name + " " + title
print(full_name)
```

# Expected Output:
Swift_Shadow_Assassin The Legendary

# Code Block 4 (Slide 6: Variables Stay Independent)
```python
hero_speed = 0.1
enemy_speed = 50.0

hero_speed = 0.05
print(enemy_speed)  # still 50.0
```

# Expected Output:
50.0

# Code Block 5 (Slide 7: Stay Organized (Prefixes))
```python
player_hp = 50
player_xp = 500

enemy_hp = 500
